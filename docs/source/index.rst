Welcome to logics' documentation!
=================================

Logics is a Python framework for mathematical logic. It aims at generality (being able to represent as many systems
as possible), well-documented and readable code and minimal dependencies, rather than speed. Some of its intended
applications are educational software (e.g. `TAUT <https://taut-logic.com/>`_, which uses a previous version of this
package), and quick prototyping of ideas for research purposes.
